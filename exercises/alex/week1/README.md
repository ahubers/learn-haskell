# Week 1 chapter notes

Haskell Pros and Cons

## Pros

* Reads like mathematics
* Save a lot of time
* Works like magic

## Cons

* What runtime environment exists for this?
* Snoody bitches use Haskell
* Efficiency and syntactic sugar -- If the magic is done post-compilation, how can I elucidate my runtime complexity? 
Just because one can be pompous about declarative vs imperative code, doesn't mean computers don't run procedurally
