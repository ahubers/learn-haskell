# Tanner and Alex learn them a good Haskell

This Readme will serve the purpose of a course syllabus as Tanner and Alex learn haskell good. We will utilize two sources of instruction:

* Our "textbook" -- [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters)
* Our "homework problems" -- [exercism.io](http://exercism.io/languages/haskell)


# Syllabus

## Schedule

I googled "course syllabus in markdown" and found this table:

| 1    | 1     | Substitution Rule           | 5.5, 5.6             |
| -    | 2     | Partial Fractions           | 5.7, 5.8, Appendix G |
| 2    | 1     | Approximate Integration     | 5.9                  |
| -    | 2     | Improper Integrals          | 5.10                 |
| 3    | 1     | Areas, Volumes              | 6.1, 6.2             |

I have repopulated it with relevant information. Alex and Tanner will have a call
on each (insert day here) to discuss the chapter and compare solutions to exercises.

## Structure

Submit your solutions to your own folder in ./exercises/name/week_x for week x. 
Feel free to put any notes concerning that week's chapter in that folder's README.md.
