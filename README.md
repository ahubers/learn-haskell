# Tanner and Alex learn them a good Haskell

This Readme will serve the purpose of a course syllabus as Tanner and Alex learn haskell good. We will utilize two sources of instruction:

* Our "textbook" -- [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters)
* Our "homework problems" -- [exercism.io](http://exercism.io/languages/haskell)
