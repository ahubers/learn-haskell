# Tanner and Alex learn them a good Haskell

This Readme will serve the purpose of a course syllabus as Tanner and Alex learn haskell good. We will utilize two sources of instruction:

* Our "textbook" -- [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters)
* Our "homework problems" -- [exercism.io](http://exercism.io/languages/haskell)

# Syllabus

## Structure

Submit your solutions to your own folder in `./exercises/name/week_x` for week x. 
Feel free to put any notes concerning that week's chapter in that folder's README.md. 

The class (Alex and Tanner) will have a call on Thusday each week
to discuss the chapter and compare solutions to exercises.

## Week 1 : week of Jan 25, 2016

### Book chapters

We will be reading chapters [One](http://learnyouahaskell.com/introduction#about-this-tutorial), [Two] (http://learnyouahaskell.com/starting-out#ready-set-go) and [three] (http://learnyouahaskell.com/types-and-typeclasses#believe-the-type) of Learn you a Haskell.

### Exercises

Please follow along with the chapter and run/compile any exercises you are interested in. Save these files in this week's folder.

### Notes

We will use this week to become comfortable with writing in Haskell -- building the muscle memory and experimenting. Exercism's problems seem
to presume some knowledge of the language. This is nice in that we'll avoid any "CodeAcademy" situations (here is an int, here is an array),
but it means we will need to spend some time with the basics first.

## Week 2 : week of February 1st, 2016

### Book chapters

Read chapters [four](http://learnyouahaskell.com/syntax-in-functions) and [five](http://learnyouahaskell.com/recursion).

### Exercises

See http://exercism.io/languages/haskell and complete:

* Leap (required)
* Accumulate
* RNA Transcription
* Sublist (required)
* Grains (required)
* Gigasecond

Some problems are required so as to form a basis for discussion / comparison.

### Notes

None.
